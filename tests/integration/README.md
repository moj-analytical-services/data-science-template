# Integration Tests

Integration tests verify that multiple components work together correctly.

This is essentially testing multiple units as a group to ensure they interact as expected.

## Guidelines

- Use test databases or containers (e.g., Docker)
- Clean up resources after each test
- Verify data flows between components
- Use test fixtures for consistent setup
